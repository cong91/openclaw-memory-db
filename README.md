# Agent Smart Memo

> **ASM v5.1** is a super memory platform for coding agents: **conversation memory + project memory + retrieval/control plane**, delivered through a single package and a CLI-first install flow.

`@mrc2204/agent-smart-memo` provides a project-aware memory layer for OpenClaw plugin/runtime usage, while keeping one shared memory/config model.

Today ASM provides:

- conversation/runtime continuity
- structured slot memory
- semantic retrieval
- graph memory
- project registry + onboarding
- repo-aware indexing / reindexing
- lineage-aware engineering context retrieval
- CLI-based platform install flow for OpenClaw (plus optional OpenCode MCP bridge bootstrap)

This means ASM is best understood as:

> **a shared memory platform for coding agents, with OpenClaw as the supported plugin/runtime target**

---

## 1) Core mental model

ASM has 3 practical layers.

### A. Conversation memory

Used for runtime continuity:

- `memory_search`
- `memory_store`
- `memory_slot_*`
- `memory_graph_*`
- auto-capture / auto-recall

### B. Project memory

Used for engineering context:

- project registry
- repo root / repo remote identity
- project aliasing
- Jira linkage
- onboarding + index triggers
- lifecycle-aware retrieval boundaries

### C. Retrieval/control plane

Used to assemble better context for coding agents:

- semantic recall
- lexical/project filtering
- file/symbol/task lineage
- deterministic project-aware retrieval
- platform install / bootstrap flows

If you only remember one sentence, remember this:

> **ASM is a super memory platform for coding agents: conversation memory + project memory + runtime delivery in one package.**

---

## 2) Runtime target

### OpenClaw

Primary target today.

Includes:

- OpenClaw plugin entry
- tools / hooks / runtime wiring
- CLI bootstrap flow
- shared ASM config integration

Install:

```bash
asm install openclaw
```

### OpenCode (optional MCP integration)

Uses the same package and shared config, with MCP/local runtime wiring.

Install:

```bash
asm install opencode
```

---

## 3) Install ASM

There are currently **two supported install flows**.

### Flow A — CLI-first (recommended for ASM CLI usage)

Install the CLI globally first:

```bash
npm install -g @mrc2204/agent-smart-memo
```

Then initialize shared config:

```bash
asm init-setup --yes
```

This creates or updates:

```text
~/.config/asm/config.json
```

Then install runtime/integration target(s):

```bash
asm install openclaw
asm install opencode
```

### Flow B — Plugin-first (direct OpenClaw plugin install)

If you only want the OpenClaw plugin directly, install it through OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @mrc2204/agent-smart-memo
```

Then continue with OpenClaw-side config/bootstrap as needed.

### Important note

The command below is **not the recommended primary flow right now**:

```bash
npx @mrc2204/agent-smart-memo install
```

Use the two supported flows above until CLI bootstrap is fully separated/standardized.

---

## 4) Shared config source-of-truth

ASM now uses a shared config model.

### Canonical shared config

```text
~/.config/asm/config.json
```

### What lives there

Runtime/core fields such as:

- `projectWorkspaceRoot`
- `storage.slotDbDir`
- `llmBaseUrl`
- `llmApiKey`
- `llmModel`
- `embedBaseUrl`
- `embedBackend`
- `embedModel`
- `embedDimensions`
- `autoCaptureEnabled`
- `autoCaptureMinConfidence`
- `contextWindowMaxTokens`
- `summarizeEveryActions`

Compatibility fields (migration/export/rollback tooling window):

- `qdrantHost`
- `qdrantPort`
- `qdrantCollection`
- `qdrantVectorSize`

Primary wiki-first runtime memory paths should not be treated as Qdrant-dependent.

Bootstrap-safe behavior (Phase 2 bootstrap lane):

- Fresh environments can run capture flow even when distill/LLM extraction capability is unavailable.
- Auto-capture keeps SlotDB runtime-state updates active and applies raw-first fallback capture into wiki `raw/live/briefings`.
- Deterministic briefing generation remains enabled so startup context stays stable across repeated bootstrap runs.

Isolated continuation distill behavior (Phase 2 continuation-safe lane):

- Auto-capture distill extraction now runs in the isolated continuation lane natively (`extractWithIsolatedContinuation`) without spawning an external worker process.
- Runtime boundary is explicit 3-layer decomposition:
  - **Extractor layer** (`runExtractorLayerWithLLM` + pattern fallback): candidate signals only.
  - **Distill layer** (`runDistillLayer`): refine/select/drop/promote hints from candidates.
  - **Apply / Memory arrangement layer** (`DistillApplyUseCase.execute`): deterministic writes into SlotDB + wiki lanes (`raw`, `drafts`, `live`, `briefings`) with loop guards.
- Structured distill contract is supported with optional fields: `draft_updates`, `briefing_updates`, `log_entries`, `promotion_hints` in addition to `slot_updates`, `slot_removals`, `memories`.
- Native continuation fallback translation is continuation-side: the continuation returns a structured fallback contract (deterministic fallback extraction + diagnostic `log_entries`) rather than throwing in the hook path.
- Host auto-capture path is boundary-only: build context window -> invoke isolated continuation -> pass returned contract into deterministic apply (no host-side distill mode inference/noise routing).
- Forensic safeguard: same-session direct `sendEventSystemMessage`/`heartbeatnow` distill primitive is not used as primary path because auto-capture is attached to `agent_end` and loop risk is high.

### Platform-local config

Platform config should stay minimal.

For OpenClaw, `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` should mainly keep:

- `enabled`
- required runtime fields:
  - `projectWorkspaceRoot`
  - `slotDbDir`
  - `wikiDir`

Example OpenClaw plugin entry:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "config": {
    "projectWorkspaceRoot": "/Users/your-user/Work/projects",
    "slotDbDir": "/Users/your-user/.openclaw/agent-memo",
    "wikiDir": "/Users/your-user/Work/projects/agent-smart-memo/memory/wiki"
  }
}
```

`qmdRoot` stays internal and is derived from `wikiDir` at runtime.

## 5) OpenClaw quick start

### Install from npm (CLI-first)

```bash
npm install -g @mrc2204/agent-smart-memo
asm init-setup --yes
asm install openclaw --yes
```

### Install plugin directly into OpenClaw (plugin-first)

```bash
openclaw plugins install @mrc2204/agent-smart-memo
```

### Install locally from source

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node bin/asm.mjs init-setup --yes
node bin/asm.mjs install openclaw --yes
```

### Verification

```bash
npm run test:asm-cli
npx tsx tests/test-init-openclaw.ts
npm run build:plugin
```

---

## 6) Project-aware onboarding flow

ASM supports operator-friendly project onboarding.

### Telegram/OpenClaw command

```text
/asm_project_index <repo_url>
```

### Current behavior

- resolves repo path/identity when possible
- supports local path import without forced clone
- can reuse an already-registered remote/project identity
- can attach Jira mapping
- can trigger background index flow

Typical path:

1. operator runs `/asm_project_index <repo_url>`
2. preview shows resolved repo + onboarding choices
3. operator confirms
4. ASM bridges into register / tracker-link / index flow

Relevant areas in the repo include:

- project registry
- onboarding command flows
- background indexing hooks
- lineage-aware retrieval tests

## 11) Current positioning

A good public-facing description for this repo is:

> **Agent Smart Memo is a project-aware super memory platform for coding agents, shipped as one package with CLI-first installation for OpenClaw and optional OpenCode MCP integration.**

It helps agents:

- remember conversation/runtime state
- store and retrieve structured + semantic knowledge
- onboard and map projects
- index and reindex repos
- assemble better engineering context
- reuse one shared config and one shared memory core across runtimes
